Ldap Component
==============

A Ldap client for PHP on top of PHP's ldap extension.

Disclaimer
----------

This component is only stable since Makhan 3.1. Earlier versions
have been marked as internal as they still needed some work.
Breaking changes were introduced in Makhan 3.1, so code relying on
previous version of the component will break with this version.
