HttpKernel Component
====================

The HttpKernel component provides a structured process for converting a Request
into a Response by making use of the EventDispatcher component. It's flexible
enough to create a full-stack framework (Makhan), a micro-framework (Silex) or
an advanced CMS system (Drupal).
